  "If you take your eyes off sad things, they will happen again one day. If you keep running, you will keep repeating the same mistakes. That's why you need to face the truth directly. Fear is not evil. It shows you what your frankness is. And when you know your openness, then you can become stronger and kinder.",
  "It may be difficult right now, but you must silence those thoughts. Stop counting the things you've lost, what's gone is gone. So ask yourself what is left for you. The loneliest people are the kindest. The saddest people smile the most. The most hurt people are the wisest. That's because they don't want to see anyone else suffer the way they did.",
  "Strong people don't knock others down, they help them up. Only those who have suffered for a long time can see light through the shadows. Wounds in your heart are different from wounds in your body and there is only one thing that can heal them, love.",
  "Naruto can be a little tough sometimes, maybe you don't know but he also grew up without a father and never had any friends in our village, in fact he never knew any of his parents but I never saw him cry my guess, he got tired of crying",
  "But the only one he couldn't kill, was his brother. A man who cried tears of blood, who had to throw away his emotions to kill all his relatives and friends. He didn't have the heart to kill you. Do you understand what that means?",
  "Even wounded, one can sleepâ€¦ But if one causes the wound, there is no peace, if one is exiled, one cannot sleep. We make many mistakes, although what we can do is learn from them and strive not to repeat them.",
  "Do you know which is the best and at the same time the worst invention created by man? The television! Television manipulates people by making them lose their sense of reality. Today, religion is television. Television has created human beings who are easily deceived by a lie.",
  "They themselves put into practice what they believe in willingly. Why do men believe in God? Because they want to believe. It is not easy to live in this hopelessly corrupted world, yet they continue to live in it.",
  "Greed, avarice, lust, gluttony, pride. It is the body that allows these desires to arise, and as long as we have these desires, the ego of human beings will exist. Men will continue to fight to satisfy their desires. If we continue like this, there will be no future."
